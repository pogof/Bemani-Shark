# Bemani-Shark
Post-dissector addon for Wireshark to dissect Eamusement communication  

## What is this?
Bemani games send HTTP requests that include a header and data. This Post-dissector will take these and parse them into a reasonably readable format to be processed further.

## What this is not (yet?)
This tool will not unencrypt and uncompress the data, it will simply show you the data in the final compressed and encrypted form. You will have to write yourself a tool to do these.

## Little bit about how the data works
